**llspy-slm** is a simple python app for generating binary masks to drive the spatial light modulator (SLM) on Lattice Light Sheet microscopes. It can generate both *square lattices* and *hex lattices*, and includes the ability to automatically set various parameters such as wavelength dependent beam-spacing (fully manually control is also available).  Additionally, there is a batch square lattice feature that can be used to generate a large number of parameter permutations easily.
